      ClipConcise is a platform designed to provide users with summarized versions of YouTube videos for convenience and efficiency. While we strive to offer accurate and informative summaries, it's important to note the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Views Reduction:</strong> Summarizing YouTube videos may result in reduced views for the original content creators. ClipConcise does not intend to diminish or undermine the efforts of content creators, and users are encouraged to visit the original videos for the full viewing experience and to support the creators.</li>
      <li><strong>AI Summarization:</strong> Our summaries are generated using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which aim to capture the essence of the original content. However, these summaries may not always capture every single important point or nuance present in the video. Users should consider the summaries as supplemental aids and not as replacements for viewing the original content.</li>
      <li><strong>Fair Use:</strong> ClipConcise operates under the principles of fair use and aims to provide transformative value to users by offering summarized content. We respect the intellectual property rights of content creators and encourage users to adhere to copyright laws when using our platform.</li>
      <li><strong>User Discretion:</strong> Users of ClipConcise should exercise discretion when relying on the summarized content. While we strive for accuracy, we cannot guarantee the completeness or correctness of the summaries. Users are encouraged to verify information from the original source when necessary.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      By using ClipConcise, users acknowledge and accept the terms outlined in this disclaimer. We encourage responsible use of our platform and support the creative community on YouTube.
